Yet the second law is probably our most powerful aid in helping us
**understand why the world** works as it does both in simple and in complex
ways: why hot pans cool down, why ping pong balls don't bounce *forever when
they are* dropped, why gasoline (plus the oxygen in air) makes engines run,
why our "engines" --- our bodies --- run and we continue to live and our bodies stay
warm even when it's cold, but also why we die when some chemical reactions
within us fail.

In fact, the second law helps to explain everything that
happens in our physical world. In chemistry, it's especially important because
it can tell us whether any chemical reaction that we write on paper will
probably be spontaneous and go as we have written it...

That’s why iron reacts with oxygen—to release energy from their combined total
of higher energy
bonds and form the lower energy bonds in iron oxide. Then, all that difference
in energy becomes dispersed to the surroundings as heat i.e., the reaction is
exothermic and makes molecules in the surroundings move faster. But remember how
chemical reactions occur! Remember that it requires energy to break bonds
reaction there must be some extra energy, an activation energy supplied somehow
to break a bond or many bonds in the reacting substances. (For information about
activation energies, see http://www.2ndlaw.com/obstructions.html) Then, if the
bonds that are being formed in the product are much stronger than those being
broken in the reactants, that difference in energy (which usually causes greater
motion energy of all the molecules) can feed back to break more bonds in the
reactants.

## The Big Problem

Unfortunately, for almost a century and
a half, the second law has been expressed by experts in ways that a beginner in
chemistry could not possibly understand without a great deal of additional
explanation. Here are just three of some 25 explanations that have been most
prominent:

* Clausius: ``The entropy of the universe increases toward
a maximum''
* Planck: "It is impossible in any way to diminish the
entropy of a system of bodies without thereby leaving behind changes in other
bodies"
* Lewis: "In any irreversible process the total entropy of all
bodies concerned is increased."

Entropy, entropy, entropy! But what
is entropy? Even some textbooks still say something like "Don't ask about
understanding it. Just work the problems that have entropy in them and you'll
gradually understand it because you will be able to work with it"! That's the
old way which fortunately has been discarded by most US general chemistry
texts. (See list at <a
href="http://www.entropysite.com/#whatsnew">http://www.entropysite.com/#whatsnew</a>.)
The good news of the twenty-first century is that now entropy can be described
as a simple idea (no matter how complex to calculate and deal with in advanced
courses and research.) Because of our new conceptual approach, a basic version
of the second law can be understood easily.

## Examples from Everyday Life

Let's see how the second law helps us to understand our common
experience better, to see how so many totally different events really are just
examples of energy dispersing or spreading out, i.e., of the second law. A rock
will fall if you lift it up and then let go. Hot frying pans cool down when
taken off the stove. Iron rusts (oxidizes) in the air. Air in a tire is at a
high pressure and shoots out even from a small puncture to the lower pressure
atmosphere. Ice cubes melt in a warm room.

### A Falling Rock

A rock has potential energy (PE) localized in it when you lift it up above the
ground. The rock is the system; everything else it encounters is the
surroundings.

#### A Hot Frying Pan

A hot frying pan?  The iron atoms in a hot frying pan (system) in a room
(surroundings) are vibrating very
rapidly, like fast "dancing in place". Therefore, considering both the pan and
the room, the motion energy in the hot pan is localized. That motion energy will
disperse—if it is not hindered, according to the second law.

Whenever the
less rapidly moving molecules in the cooler air of the room hit the hot pan, the
fast-vibrating iron atoms transfer some of their energy to the air
molecules. The pan’s localized energy thus becomes dispersed, spread out more
widely to molecules in the room air.


## Recap and Conclusion

Rocks
falling down mountains, hot pans cooling in cool rooms, anything made of iron
rusting, anything burning or reacting with oxygen, all these types of
spontaneous events and chemical reactions that occur by themselves are due to
energy dispersing or spreading out. Entropy is the quantitative measure of how
much energy and how much dispersal occurs in a process or a reaction. Therefore,
entropy is constantly increasing because spontaneous events continue to occur in
our energy-rich universe. Thus, we can decipher the following statement of the
second law:

1) "In any irreversible process the total entropy of all
bodies concerned is increased."
2) "In any process in which energy
becomes spread out, the measure of that spreading out or dispersing (i.e., the
total entropy) increases when you include both what happens in the system AND
its surroundings."
